## Important Notes about the Files

- `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebooks): 
  - Contain the full code for symptom identification, risk factor identification, and keyword selection.
  - Some notebooks may not render properly on GitHub due to metadata issues, but they can be opened locally without problems.

- `.pdf` Files:
  - Each `.pdf` file is a static export of the corresponding `.ipynb` notebook.
  - **The PDFs preserve the original outputs/results** generated when the notebooks were first executed, including:
    - Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
    - Confusion matrices
    - Sample predictions
  - If you cannot open the `.ipynb` correctly online, you can directly check the `.pdf` to review the results.

- `.zip` Files:
  - Each `.zip` archive contains the datasets used for model training and evaluation.
  - These datasets were derived from PubMed abstracts and labeled based on specific keyword rules for symptoms and environmental risk factors.
